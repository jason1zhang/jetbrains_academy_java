/**
 * Citizens of the country named Malevia often experiment with the shapes of their rooms.
 * The rooms can be triangular, rectangular, and round.
 *
 * Write a program that calculates the floor area of the rooms.
 * Input data format: The type of the room shape and the relevant parameters.
 * Output data format: The area of the resulting room.
 *
 * Note that the value of 3.14 is used instead of the number Ï€ in Malevia.
 *
 * Input format used by the Malevians:
 *
 * triangle
 * a
 * b
 * c
 * where a, b, and c are lengths of the triangle sides.
 *
 * rectangle
 * a
 * b
 * where a and b are lengths of the rectangle sides.
 *
 * circle
 * r
 * where r is the radius of the circle.
 *
 * Note that the input values (a, b, c, r) are doubles, and your answer should be too.
 *
 * 
 * Sample Input 1:
 * rectangle
 * 4
 * 10
 * 
 * Sample Output 1:
 * 40.0
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Input 2:
 * circle
 * 5
 * 
 * Sample Output 2:
 * 78.5
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Input 3:
 * triangle
 * 3
 * 3
 * 3
 * 
 * Sample Output 3:
 * 3.897114317029974
