/**
 * Let's introduce the term k-combination. It is a subset of k distinct elements of a given set.
 *
 * Two combinations are called different if one of the combinations contains an element, which is
 * not present in the other combination.
 *
 * The number of k-combinations of a set of n elements is the number of different such combinations.
 * Let’s write this number as C(n, k).
 *
 * It is easy to understand that C(n, 0) = 1, as you can select 0 elements from the set of n elements
 * by the only way: namely, by not choosing anything.
 * Also, it is easy to understand that if k > n, then C(n, k) = 0, as it is impossible, for example,
 * to choose five elements from the three given ones.
 * The following recurrent formula is used to calculate C(n, k) in the other cases: C(n, k) = C(n – 1, k) + C(n – 1, k – 1).
 *
 * You need to implement a method, which calculates C(n, k) for the specified n and k. It should use
 * the recurrent formula to calculate C(n, k).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Let n = 3, i.e. there are three elements (1, 2, 3). Let k = 2.
 * All the different 2-combination of 3 elements: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3).
 * There are three different combinations, thus C(3, 2) = 3.
